2. Deploy either of the security checks: **[UserLogin](https://pmf.persistentproducts.com/tutorials/en/foundation/9.0/application-development/authentication-and-security/user-authentication/security-check/)** or **[PinCodeAttempts](https://pmf.persistentproducts.com/tutorials/en/foundation/9.0/application-development/authentication-and-security/credentials-validation/security-check/)**.
